This project attempts to compile and link a "single" static library
of Geant4 (http://geant4.cern.ch) using the maven-nar-plugin.

You will (for the moment) need clhep compiled by hand or download
the binary for you platform (http://cern.ch/clhep).

The checkout of this project ONLY contains the file(s) necessary
to compile with NAR. The sources you need to overlay for the 
Geant4 version you want to compile. 

Edit (for now) the pom.xml file to point to the correct version of
clhep.

Run "mvn" and look for the static library in (for example):

geant4.9.3/target/nar/geant4-4.9.3-SNAPSHOT-x86_64-MacOSX-g++-static/lib/x86_64-MacOSX-g++/static/

This example was (for the moment) only tested on x86-MacOSX-g++.
